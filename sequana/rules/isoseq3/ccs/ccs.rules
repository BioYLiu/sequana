    Each sequencing run is processed by ccs to generate one representative circular consensus sequence (CCS) for each ZMW.
    Only ZMWs with at least one full pass (at least one subread with SMRT adapter on both ends) are used for the
    subsequent analysis. Polishing is not necessary in this step and is by default deactivated through.
